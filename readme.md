## Simple test of Pyxel Game Engine

#### I decided on testing Pyxel as it seems simpler to teach then PyGame and works with OpenGL

This is just a simple text-based adventure game and just a scene in that. Eventually you'd add this to a whole set of scenes and have the game.

1. First iteration: Just Displays the openning splash screen ("Welcome to our adventure!")
2. 2nd iteration: Adds the simple question/answer movement controls
   - "You come to a break in the hall: Which way to you go?"
3. 3rd iteration: Swaps question/answer for question + Event Listener (button press)
4. 4th iteration: Makes button press make sense and add depth
   - Simple inventory
   - Backtracking decisions (L, R, L down hallway -> need key from first R ... go back)
   - Better story
   - Second area
5. 5th iteration: Adds some simple images
   - For second area and characters
6. 6th iteration: Adds some simple animation
